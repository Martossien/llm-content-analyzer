# Corrections Summary

This document lists the main corrections and additions made to the project to restore the expected behaviour of Brique 2.

## Implemented features
- Added full module initialisation in `ContentAnalyzer` including caching and database managers.
- Implemented `analyze_single_file` and `analyze_batch` orchestrating the complete workflow.
- Removed path cleaning in `CSVParser` and ensured CSV data is imported without modification.
- Added missing GUI controls including single file analysis, batch operations and navigation buttons in the results viewer.

## Notes
These changes fix missing methods and allow proper processing of SMBeagle CSV files while preserving UNC paths.

## Extension Normalization
- Extensions from CSV rows are now normalized with a leading dot before filtering
  to ensure blocked extensions like `.zip` are excluded correctly.

## Threading and Security Fixes
- Implemented interruptible waiting in `SmartMultiWorkerAnalysisThread` for fast
  stop responsiveness.
- Propagated stop events in `APITestThread` ensuring API tests can be cancelled
  promptly.
- Replaced `SQLiteConnectionManager` with `SQLiteConnectionPool` in `DBManager`
  to prevent cross-thread corruption.
- Hardened `SQLQueryOptimizer` against SQL injection with column whitelisting
  and strict validation.
