# Corrections Summary

This document lists the main corrections and additions made to the project to restore the expected behaviour of Brique 2.

## Implemented features
- Added full module initialisation in `ContentAnalyzer` including caching and database managers.
- Implemented `analyze_single_file` and `analyze_batch` orchestrating the complete workflow.
- Removed path cleaning in `CSVParser` and ensured CSV data is imported without modification.
- Added missing GUI controls including single file analysis, batch operations and navigation buttons in the results viewer.

## Notes
These changes fix missing methods and allow proper processing of SMBeagle CSV files while preserving UNC paths.
